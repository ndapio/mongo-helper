## Mongo Helper

A MongoDB's CRUD wrapper for PHP. Neat and easy to use.

General idea:
- MongoConnector.php connect to MongoDB and do CRUD queries.
- MongoModel.php is a object class to be extended. The class will map MongoDB into object and do business logic.
- MongoModelCollection.php is a collection class to be extended. The class is working as a collection (list/array/datasets) and save/load documents to MongoDB.

## Guide

You can extend the MongoModel and MongoModelCollection class to use in your project.
